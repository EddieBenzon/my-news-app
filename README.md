Project notes:

- The article content of the "Home" tab wasn't defined, so I set it to show all articles from the "Entertainment" category, as it was the only one missing from the category buttons, considering how the "General" category was already taken.

- Couldn't find an endpoint that returns the "category" in the response object (using NewsAPI). Instead the articles show the source website above the title.
